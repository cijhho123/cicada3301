A Koan

A man decided to go and study with a master.
He went to the door of the master
"who are you who wishes to study here?"
asked the master.
The student told the master his name.
"That is not what you are that is only what you are called.
Who are you who wishes to study here?" he asked
again.
The man thought for a moment, and replied
"I am a professor."
"That is what you do, not what you are"
replied the master. "Who are
you who wishes to study here?"
Confused, the man thought some more.
Finally, he answered, "I am a human being."
"That is only your species, not who you are.
Who are you who wishes to study here?"
asked the master again.
After a moment of thought, the professor replied 
"I am a consciousness inhabiting an arbitrary body."
"That is merely what you are not who you are"
who are you who wishes to study here?"
The man was getting irritated. "I am," he started, 
but he could not think of anything else to say,
so he trailed off. After a long pause the master replied
"then you are welcome to come study."
